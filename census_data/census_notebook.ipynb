    "### Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following questions: \n",
    "- Who is my customer? \n",
    "- Where should I relocate my plant or headquarters, given the skill set I require of workers? \n",
    "- Where would be a good location for a new store, given my knowledge of my customer? \n",
    "\n",
    "**How would you answer these questions?** This lecture illustrate one set of tools to answer these questions: Get detailed demographic information about the people that live in a given area using the US census.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the [US census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census)? Every 10 years the US government is required to essentially count all people within the United States and in doing so constructs detailed demographic information about the peopel living and working within fine geographic levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "A new innovation that is of interest to us is the [American Community Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey). This is a Survey (not a census), but it asks the long-form questions whose answers can then be matched up with the 10 year census in a way to provide information at a **yearly** frequency. So you can find out median household income in zip code 90210 for 2015, 2014, etc. actually only going back to 2010 since this is a new development.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second development is that the US census has a well developed API for which we can directly access the data. In the past, this process would look like this: bulk download `.csv` files, pull what you need, store it, etc. Now on the fly you can get what you want directly (and I think the main user of this are commercial vendors, e.g. like you look at Zillow and some characteristics of that zip code are reported, this is a direct feed from the census). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are we going to do with it?** We will learn how to use the Census API and then use information to ask who voted for Trump or Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election. This is a nice application because, we know election results at very fine levels of geography, but we will never know individual votes. But we can `merge` the election results up with demographic information at those fine geographic locations and be able to make statements like \"areas with a less educated population were more likely to vote for candidate X\" Along the way, we will learn some more stuff:\n",
    "- Census API\n",
    "- More practice `merge`ing\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this will fit with the next lecture on mapping.\n",

Here is why this is important: If the data does not pass (i) or the \"plot test\" as one of my former colleague called it, then this is suggest that you should view any results from (ii) with skeptisisim (does not mean it may not be true, just that more needs to be established).\n",

One way to get at this is the following: create bins by income level...like poor, middle, rich, and look at the share of votes going to Trump by each bin. If we see, Trump's vote share declining as income rises, this suggests that income level in a factor in determining who voted for Trump. We can do the same by population (with less populated counties taken to be rural)...\n",
