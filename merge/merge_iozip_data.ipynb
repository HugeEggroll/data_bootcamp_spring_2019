    "Sometimes we need to combine data. In many instances, adding additional data is a way to enrich both the questions that can be asked of your original data set and the answers that can be provided. This notebook looks at ways to  create one dataframe from two or more dataframes.  That's colloquially known as a **merge** or a **join**. There are lots of ways to do this.  We do a couple but supply references to more at the end.  \n",

What you need to provide pandas are the two data frames, the type of merge, and the ``key`` to merge on. Below, I'm going to look at a couple of common examples that I come across, one-to-one merges and many to one merges (in the documentation there is a discussion of many to many merges).
