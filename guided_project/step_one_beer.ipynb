    "IRI dataset is a scanner level data set encompasing about 12 years, 93 markets in the United States. Scanner means the level of observation is at the upc-barcode scanner level. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several layers to the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First there the \"product_files\" with product descriptions. These provide UPC codes, some description of the product, e.g. \"Bud  Light, Long Neck Bottles, 6 pack, total fluid ounces\" and information about the producer, vendor (in this case Anheuser Busch).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next there is by year, the store level dataset. This is broken down by type of store (grocery vs drug store) and some supplementary datasets for the panel dimension. This is also known as the \"scanner\" dataset and the main files here are labeled like this ``beer_groc_XXXX_YYYY`` where XXX and YYY match up with the weeks in each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One key step is to get the UPC codes for the products that we care about, then match the product level information with the scanner data set. This will allow us to construct prices, by brand, across time (and markets). \n",
    "\n",
    "The key step we need to accomplish is to understand the product file. And work towards being able to find and grab the UPCs for specific brands and formats. Below we walk through these steps."

So each row is a list, with each item in the list being the seperate item. Can you see where the size (total number of OZs) of the product is showing up?\n",

    "#### Determining the Format of the Product.\n",
    "\n",
    "H. Same deal as F. When looking at the description notice how you see things like \"CNIBX\" or \"LNBTL\" which correspond with the description of the format (first one is can in box, the other is long necks in box). As in F. use string methods to create a new series which details this description.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note, the issue here is that there are multiple formats which are very similar. Our strategy will be to grab them all and treat them the same. In fact, the UPCs work in the way that anytime the packaging is changed (think holiday boxes), its a new UPC***\n"
