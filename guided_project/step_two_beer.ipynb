    "- Fourth step is to use a `.groupby` to group transactions by week and then plot prices across time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Final step---scale it up. So we want to create a function that will grab the transactions for the UPCs that we want. Then with our Use our function from `step_one` and grab all the UPCs for all brands that we care about, apply the function created to get the transactions. Then we `.groupby` on brand and week. Then we are ready plot the price by brand over time. "
