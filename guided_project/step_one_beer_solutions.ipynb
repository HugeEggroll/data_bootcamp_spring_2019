    "IRI dataset is a scanner level data set encompasing about 12 years, 93 markets in the United States. Scanner means the level of observation is at the upc-barcode scanner level. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several layers to the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First there the \"product_files\" with product descriptions. These provide UPC codes, some description of the product, e.g. \"Bud  Light, Long Neck Bottles, 6 pack, total fluid ounces\" and information about the producer, vendor (in this case Anheuser Busch).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next there is by year, the store level dataset. This is broken down by type of store (grocery vs drug store) and some supplementary datasets for the panel dimension. This is also known as the \"scanner\" dataset and the main files here are labeled like this ``beer_groc_XXXX_YYYY`` where XXX and YYY match up with the weeks in each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One key step is to get the UPC codes for the products that we care about, then match the store level information with the scanner data set. This will allow us to construct prices fir "

As in F. use string methods to create a new series which details this description.\n",
